Key implementation details:

1. HTTP Status Codes:

- 202 Accepted for initial request and intermediate status checks

- 200 OK when processing completes

- 404 Not Found for invalid IDs

2. Polling Mechanism:

- Location header points to status endpoint

- Hypermedia links guide client through state transitions

- Retry-After could be implemented via Cache-Control headers

3. Components:

- Background task queue for async processing

- In-memory storage for demonstration (use database in production)

- HATEOAS-compliant links in responses

This implementation follows the asynchronous request-reply pattern with:

- Proper HTTP status code usage

- HATEOAS principles for discoverability

- Background processing separation

- Clean status tracking interface

- Scalable task queue architecture
