### A small C# console app that demonstrates the Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL) Pattern 

It includes:

- A domain model (Customer)
- A legacy DTO (LegacyCustomerDto)
- A translator for mapping between models
- A fake legacy service
- An adapter that acts as the ACL

You can run this as a .NET Console App.
